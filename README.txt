This is a simple database that keeps track of the books you have read.

Details of the book include:
  Book Title
  Book Author
  Book Pages
  Book Rating
  Date Finished

Beginning with an empty database you will have the option to "ADD BOOK"

After you have added any book(s) to your personal database, you will be able to edit
 all details and delete the book altogether.

Thats all there is to it! Compete with friends to see who can read the most pages in a year!
